    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Goulash (Hungarian: gulyás), is a soup or stew of meat and vegetables seasoned with paprika and other spices. Goulash came from Hungary and is commonly eaten in Central Europe and other parts of Europe. It is one of the national dishes of Hungary and a symbol of the country.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg/2 lb beef chuck , cut in 3.5cm / 1.5″ cubes</li>
        <li>1 3/4 tsp cooking salt / kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp/ 30g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 brown onions , cut into 1cm / 1/2″ squares</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves , finely minced</li>
        <li>2 capsicum/bell peppers (1 red + 1 yellow), cut into 2 cm / 0.8″ squares</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes , cut into 8 wedges then in half</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Hungarian-style paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp caraway seeds , optional</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 litre / 4 cups beef stock/broth , low-sodium</li>
        <li>2 carrots , peeled, cut in quarters lengthwise then into 1cm / 0.4″ pieces</li>
        <li>2 potatoes , cut into 1.2cm / 1/2″ cubes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp finely chopped parsley , optional garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan), though you can use your slow cooker or stove instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Season beef –</strong> Toss the beef with half the salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook onion –</strong> Heat the oil and melt the butter in a large oven-proof dutch oven over high heat. Cook onion for 6 minutes until the edges are light golden.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook beef –</strong> Add the beef and stir until the outside changes from red to brown, about 2 minutes. It won't go golden brown, it's not supposed to.</li>
        <li><strong>Add vegetables –</strong> Add garlic, capsicum and tomato. Stir for 3 minutes – the tomato will mostly breakdown.</li>
        <li><strong>Add paprika,</strong> caraway and bay leaf. Stir for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Slow cook –</strong> Add beef stock, stir, bring to simmer. Cover with a lid and transfer to the oven for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Add potato –</strong> The beef should be pretty tender but not quite "fall-apart". Stir in carrot and potatoes. Return to oven, covered, for another 30 minutes. Beef should now be "fall-apart" – if not, return to the oven for 10 minutes at a time.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve –</strong> Ladle goulash into bowls and sprinkle with parsley. Eat as is, with optional bread for dunking! (Pictured with cheese bread)</li>
    </ol>
